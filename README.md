Overview

Welcome to my submission for Task 04 of the Software Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
In this task, I developed a Sudoku Solver program that automatically solves an unsolved Sudoku puzzle using algorithmic techniques.

Task Description

Task 04: Implement a Sudoku Solver

The objective of this task is to build a program that:

Accepts an unsolved 9×9 Sudoku grid as input

Uses backtracking or other suitable algorithms to explore valid solutions

Fills in all missing numbers while following Sudoku rules

Displays the completed Sudoku grid once solved

🧩 Features

Accepts partially filled Sudoku grids

Automatically solves the puzzle

Uses backtracking algorithm for accurate results

Ensures Sudoku constraints:

Unique numbers in each row

Unique numbers in each column

Unique numbers in each 3×3 subgrid

Displays the solved Sudoku in a clear grid format

🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment

Programming Concepts Applied

Backtracking algorithm

Recursion

Nested loops

Conditional statements

Functions

Matrix (2D list) handling

🔍 Program Workflow
1️⃣ Input Sudoku Grid

The user provides a 9×9 Sudoku grid

Empty cells are represented using 0 or .

2️⃣ Validation Check

The program checks whether a number can be placed safely

Validates row, column, and 3×3 subgrid constraints

3️⃣ Solving Using Backtracking

Tries numbers from 1 to 9

Recursively fills empty cells

Backtracks if a number leads to an invalid solution

4️⃣ Display Output

Prints the completed and valid Sudoku grid

📊 Example Input
5 3 0 | 0 7 0 | 0 0 0
6 0 0 | 1 9 5 | 0 0 0
0 9 8 | 0 0 0 | 0 6 0
------+-------+------
8 0 0 | 0 6 0 | 0 0 3
4 0 0 | 8 0 3 | 0 0 1
7 0 0 | 0 2 0 | 0 0 6
------+-------+------
0 6 0 | 0 0 0 | 2 8 0
0 0 0 | 4 1 9 | 0 0 5
0 0 0 | 0 8 0 | 0 7 9

✅ Output

Displays the fully solved Sudoku puzzle following all Sudoku rules.

Conclusion

This task enhanced my understanding of recursion, backtracking algorithms, and logical problem-solving.
The Sudoku Solver demonstrates how algorithmic thinking can be applied to solve complex constraint-based problems efficiently.
